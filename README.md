Below are the list of source code and generated data during the preliinary studies and the main experiment.  The section on the paper is annotated for simpler tracking.
## Soure code


*   EA.html : the main web application UI (3.2. System overview)

*   main.py : define and execute back-end functions (3.3. Character Space Construction algorithm).

## Generated Data


*   ExperimentAA_AN_NN_VVall_response.csv : the participants response to compound phrases in different PoS (3.1.Preliminary study for adjective-adjective compound phrases).
*   SingleWord_U_score.csv : the 200 adjectives labed by expert designers for an input to the gradient boosting predicting unusable words (3.3. Character Space Construction algorithm, 'CalculateWordScore' function on Table 1). 
*   Combination_rating.csv : the 130 adjective phrases rated by expert designers to assign the score for sorting new word1 - word2 combinations (.3. Character Space Construction algorithm, the function 'CalculatePhraseScore' on Table 1).
